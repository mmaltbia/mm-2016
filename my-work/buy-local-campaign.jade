	p The print collateral turned out to be eyecatching and engaging, while also fulfilling the goal of educating residents on the benefits of shopping locally. Businesses and residents alike were excited to be apart of this campaign with a cause.

	p I also worked on designing a registration site, where local business owners can sign up to learn more about the Merchants Associations upcoming events and initiatives.

	p All of this adds up to a great, interactive experience that will keep local businesses engaged with Heartland Merchants Association.
